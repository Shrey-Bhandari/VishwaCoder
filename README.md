# üåø AI-Driven Leaf Health Assessment, Damage Quantification, and LAI Calculation

A cutting-edge solution that empowers users to effortlessly assess plant health, quantify damage, and calculate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of their crops. Simply upload an image of a plant leaf, and our sophisticated AI models will provide a detailed analysis, including **disease severity**, **damage percentage**, and an **audio summary** of the results.
