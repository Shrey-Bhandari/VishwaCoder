#üåø AI-Driven Leaf Health Assessment, Damage Quantification, and LAI Calculation

A cutting-edge solution that empowers users to effortlessly assess plant health, quantify damage, and calculate the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of their crops. Simply upload an image of a plant leaf, and our sophisticated AI models will provide a detailed analysis, including disease severity, damage percentage, and an audio summary of the results.

‚ú® Features
Automated Leaf Health Assessment: Our AI models can accurately identify and classify common plant diseases.

Damage Quantification: Get a precise percentage of the damaged leaf area.

LAI Calculation: The system estimates the Leaf Area Index, a key metric for agricultural health and yield.

Audio Feedback: Receive an audible summary of the analysis for a convenient, hands-free experience.

User-Friendly Interface: A simple, intuitive platform designed for farmers, researchers, and home gardeners alike.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies
This project is built using a robust stack of modern technologies to ensure high performance and reliability.

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for the web interface)

Backend: Python (Flask/Django)

AI/ML: TensorFlow/PyTorch (for model training and inference), OpenCV (for image processing)

Audio: Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) or a similar library for generating audio feedback
